Victory in between
After the first battle, which you survived almost miraculously, the
your spaceship hovered next to an alien wreckage. 
While analyzing the enemy ship, the onboard computer
AI system decoded a cryptic signal: "This is not just an attack.It's the start of a war. 
At the heart of the Alpha Quadrant lurks a supreme leader bent on conquering the galaxy."

Then you're given the next task: fight your way through the sectors, gathering upgrades, 
and find the enemy leader.
You can also ally with or fight different factions as you move through the sectors, 
to gain their resources. Hope lives in small groups of people, 
as each success you achieve reassures them that they still have a chance. 
But the enemy is constantly adapting and new threats are becoming more dangerous.

Orion 7 becomes almost part of you as you become more and more aware of it. 
But in the midst of the fight, you'll face increasingly heavy casualties. 
You hear the voices of your friends from your defensive unit as one by one they fall, but you can't give up. 
The fate of humanity now rests or falls on you.
