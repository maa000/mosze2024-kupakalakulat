The Beginnings

On 13 May 2042, ground-based radar detected some unusual activity from the direction of Alpha Centauri. 
At first thought to be a meteor shower, it soon became clear that these were not inanimate rocks. Huge metal-domed ships that slowly, 
but relentlessly moving towards the planet. Humanity was not prepared for such an attack. World leaders convened a crisis council, 
but before they could find a solution, the attack began.

You are our hero, a seasoned pilot who not only understood the gravity of the situation, but was one of the first to jump into the fray. 
Mankind's last hope is the superspace vessel Orion 7, which was quickly armed to take on the alien fleet.
